class RangeSet:
    """
    Class to for a domain/range set, allowing membership testing.

    Allows specific integer/floats, inequalities and compound inequalities.
    eg  x == 1.6, x != 6, x <= 4, 1 < x <= 14

    Excluded values must be explicitly defined rather than 'not defined'.
    eg self._excluded = [lambda x: x != 5, lambda x: x > 2] will exclude any value that *doesn't*
    equal 5, as well as a value that is greater than 2.

    Note: if only excluding constraints are provided, self._included will be initialised with
    `lambda x: True` such that `self._included = [lambda x: True]`

Add add/remove constraint machinery:

      self._included, it should remove/overwrite the blanket value. This could be accomplished in the __init__ using a
