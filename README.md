**Worksheet generator** application (name to be refined later) is designed to take input in various forms, and generate worksheets/assignments, tests.
Goal is to accept text, Excel, Blackboard files as input, as well as via a GUI (including producing graphs).
Goal is to output PDF, Blackboard formats.
Goal is to be able to random-generate multiple versions of tests/worksheets/solutions, random generate simple(ish) math questions and graphs (with stipulations as to difficulty - whole numbers, fraction complexity, etc), have a database repository of tagged questions to build from, to allow in GUI editing/formatting, to support zipgrade/scantron grading technologies.
